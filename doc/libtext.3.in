.SH "DESCRIPTION"
read reads a line from input, validates that the line is well formed and splits
the line to a sequence of fields separated by the contents of sep. The
arguments that follow sep are all output arguments.   The first field is
assigned to the output argument that follows sep.  If the variadic overload is
used then the second field is assigned to the next output argument, etc.  read
converts the value of the read field from const char* to the type of the output
argument.
The line is well formed when the line is a sequence of fields separated by the
contents of sep and the line begins and ends with a field and the value of each
field can be converted to the type of the related output argument and the line
has enough fields to initialize all output arguments.  If the line has fewer
fields than there are output arguments then read initializes as many output
arguments as there are fields (starting from the leftmost) and keeps the
subsequent output arguments intact.
An output argument can be 0 or an address of a variable of one of the following
types int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t,
float, double, long double, std::string.  If an output argument has value 0
then read does not assign the related field.
.nf

std::string host;
uint16_t port;
libtext::read("example.com:80", ":", &host, &port);
assert(host == "example.com");
assert(port == 80);
libtext::read("example.com:80", ":", 0, &port);
// "example.com" is not assinged to any output argument.
assert(port == 80);

.fi
Passing any integer other than 0 as value of an output argument causes
undefined behavior.

While reading a field read skips trailing and leading spaces and horizontal
tabs of arbitrary length. While matching a char in sep against a char in input
read considers space equal horizontal tab.  It is necessary to consider space
equal tab to parse hand written files like /etc/fstab where space and tab are
used interchangeably.


nextline finds the address of the character immediately following the first
newline character in the input.

oneline builds a copy of a substring of the input from the beginning until the
first newline character.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If a well formed line has more fields than there are output arguments then read
returns the address of the field immediately following the rightmost read
field. If a well formed line has the same number of fields as there are output
arguments then read returns the address of the character that terminates the
line (a new line character or a null terminator).  If the line is malformed
read returns 0.

nextline returns the address of the character immediately following the first
newline character in the input. If there is no newline character in the input
then nextline returns the address of the null terminator.

oneline returns a copy of a substring of the input from the beginning until the
first newline character. If there is no newline character in input the one line
return a copy of input.

.SH "EXAMPLE"
This program shows how to use libtext::read to populate an in memory data
structure holding a copy of /etc/fstab contents.
